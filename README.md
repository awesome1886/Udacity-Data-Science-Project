# Project: Analyzing Developer Salaries
This project analyzes the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to understand the key factors that influence developer salaries.
## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## Files in this Repository
- `Udacity-Data-Science-Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- `survey_results_public.csv`: The raw dataset used for this project, downloaded from Stack Overflow.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
## Summary of Results
My analysis found that the most important predictors of salary are a developer's country, years of professional experience, and level of education. A surprising finding was that fully remote developers reported higher median salaries than their peers.
